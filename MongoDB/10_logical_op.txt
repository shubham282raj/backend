Logical operators return data based on expressions that evaluate to true or false

    > db.students.find({$and: [{fullTime: true}, {age: {$lte: 22}}]})
    > db.students.find({$or: [{fullTime: true}, {age: {$lte: 22}}]})
    > db.students.find({$nor: [{fullTime: true}, {age: {$lte: 22}}]})
    > db.students.find({$not: [{fullTime: true}, {age: {$lte: 22}}]})
    
    they both are equvivalent but if a student have age: "null"
    the first one will not return them but second one will
        > db.students.find({age: {$lt: 30}})
        > db.students.find({age: {$not: {$gte: 30}}})

$and Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses.
$not Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the query expression.
$nor Joins query clauses with a logical NOR returns all documents that fail to match both clauses.
$or Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause.
